## Description

Install endpoint protection for all virtual machines.

Installing endpoint protection systems (like anti-malware for Azure) provides for real-time protection capability that helps identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. These also offer configurable alerts when known-malicious or unwanted software attempts to install itself or run on Azure systems.

## Remediation

Follow Microsoft Azure documentation to install endpoint protection from the security center. Alternatively, you can employ your own endpoint protection tool for your OS.

### Default Value

By default Endpoint Protection is disabled.
