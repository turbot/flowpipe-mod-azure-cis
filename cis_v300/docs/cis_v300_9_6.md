## Description

Basic Authentication provides the ability to create identities and authentication for an App Service without a centralized Identity Provider. For a more effective, capable, and secure solution for Identity, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability, a centralized Identity Provider such as Entra ID is strongly advised.

Basic Authentication introduces an identity silo which can produce privileged access to a resource. This can be exploited in numerous ways and represents a significant vulnerability and attack vector.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Search for, and open `App Services` from the search bar.
2. For each App Service listed:
3. Click on the App Service name.
4. Under the `Settings` menu item, click on `Configuration`.
5. Under the `General settings` tab, scroll down to locate the two Basic Auth settings:
- Set the `SCM Basic Auth Publishing Credentials` radio button to `Off`.
- Set the `FTP Basic Auth Publishing Credentials` radio button to `Off`.

**CAUTION:** The new settings are not yet applied. Applying them may cause your App Service resource to restart - proceed with caution. Click the `Save` button, then click `Continue` to apply the updated configuration.

Repeat this procedure for each App Service.

### Default Value

Both parameters for Basic Authentication (SCM and FTP) are set to `On` by default.
