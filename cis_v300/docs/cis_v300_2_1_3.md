## Description

[**IMPORTANT - Please read the section overview:** If your organization pays for Microsoft Entra ID licensing (included in Microsoft 365 E3, E5, or F5, and EM&S E3 or E5 licenses) and **CAN** use Conditional Access, ignore the recommendations in this section and proceed to the Conditional Access section.]

Enable multi-factor authentication for all non-privileged users.

Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.
