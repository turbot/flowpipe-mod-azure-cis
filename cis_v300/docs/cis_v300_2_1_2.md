## Description

[**IMPORTANT - Please read the section overview:** If your organization pays for Microsoft Entra ID licensing (included in Microsoft 365 E3, E5, or F5, and EM&S E3 or E5 licenses) and **CAN** use Conditional Access, ignore the recommendations in this section and proceed to the Conditional Access section.]

Enable multi-factor authentication for all roles, groups, and users that have write access or permissions to Azure resources. These include custom created objects or built-in roles such as;
- Service Co-Administrators
- Subscription Owners
- Contributors

Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.

Enabling and configuring MFA with conditional access policy is a multi-step process. Here are some additional resources on the process within Entra ID to enable multi-factor authentication for users within your subscriptions with conditional access policy.
