## Description

Periodically, older versions of Python may be deprecated and no longer supported. Using a supported version of Python for app services is recommended to avoid potential unpatched vulnerabilities.

Deprecated and unsupported versions of programming and scripting languages can present vulnerabilities which may not be addressed or may not be addressable.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. From Azure Home open the Portal Menu in the top left.
2. Go to `App Services`.
3. Click on each App.
4. Under `Settings` section, click on `Configuration`.
5. Click on the General settings pane and ensure that the Major Version and the Minor Version is set to a currently supported release.

_NOTE:_ No action is required if `Python version` is set to `Off`, as Python is not used by your app.

### From Azure CLI

To see the list of supported runtimes:

```bash
az webapp list-runtimes
```

To set latest Python version for an existing app, run the following command:

```bash
az webapp config set --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> [--windows-fx-version "PYTHON|<VERSION>"] [--linux-fx-version "PYTHON|<VERSION>"]
```

### From PowerShell

As of this writing, there is no way to update an existing application's `SiteConfig` or set a new application's `SiteConfig` settings during creation via PowerShell.

### Default Value

The version of Python is whatever was selected upon App creation.
