## Overview

**IMPORTANT:** The Azure "Security Defaults" recommendations represent an entry-level set of recommendations (such as Multi-Factor Authentication) which will be relevant to organizations and tenants that are either just starting to use Azure, or are only utilizing a bare minimum feature set, and rely on the free license tier of Microsoft Entra ID. Security Defaults recommendations are intended to ensure that these use cases are still capable of establishing a strong baseline of secure configuration.

**If your subscription is licensed to use Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, it is strongly recommended that the "Security Defaults" section (this section and the recommendations therein) be bypassed in favor of the use of "Conditional Access."**
