## Description

Disable access from Azure services to `PostgreSQL flexible server`.

If access from Azure services is enabled, the server's firewall will accept connections from all Azure resources, including resources not in your subscription. This is usually not a desired configuration. Instead, set up firewall rules to allow access from specific network ranges or VNET rules to allow access from specific virtual networks.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Login to Azure Portal using https://portal.azure.com.
2. Go to `Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible servers`.
3. For each database, under `Settings`, click `Networking`.
4. Under `Firewall rules`, uncheck `Allow public access from any Azure service within Azure to this server`.
5. Click `Save`.

### From Azure CLI

Using the firewall rule name from the `Audit from Azure CLI` steps, use the below command to delete the `AllowAllAzureServicesAndResourcesWithinAzureIps` rule for PostgreSQL flexible server:

```bash
az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule delete --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <serverName> --rule-name <ruleName>
```

Type `y` and press `enter` to confirm.

### From PowerShell

Using the firewall rule name from the `Audit from PowerShell` steps, use the below command to delete the `AllowAllAzureServicesAndResourcesWithinAzureIps` rule for PostgreSQL flexible server:

```bash
Remove-AzPostgreSqlFlexibleServerFirewallRule -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroup> -ServerName <serverName> -Name <ruleName>
```

### Default Value

The Azure Postgres firewall is set to block all access by default.
