## Description

By default, App Services can be deployed over FTP. If FTP is required for an essential deployment workflow, FTPS should be required for FTP login for all App Services.

If FTPS is not expressly required for the App, the recommended setting is `Disabled.`

FTP is an unencrypted network protocol that will transmit data - including passwords - in clear-text. The use of this protocol can lead to both data and credential compromise, and can present opportunities for exfiltration, persistence, and lateral movement.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to the Azure Portal.
2. Select `App Services`.
3. Click on an app.
4. Select `Settings` and then `Configuration`.
5. Under `General Settings`, for the `Platform Settings`, the `FTP state` should be set to `Disabled` or `FTPS Only`.

### From Azure CLI

For each out of compliance application, run the following choosing either 'disabled' or 'FtpsOnly' as appropriate:

```bash
az webapp config set --resource-group <resource group name> --name <app name> --ftps-state [disabled|FtpsOnly]
```

### From Powershell

For each out of compliance application, run the following:

```bash
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -Name <app name> -FtpsState <Disabled or FtpsOnly>
```

### Default Value

By default, FTP based deployment is `All allowed`.
