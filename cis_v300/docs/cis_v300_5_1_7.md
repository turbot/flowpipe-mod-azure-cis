## Description

Disabling public network access restricts the service from accessing public networks.

A secure network architecture requires carefully constructed network segmentation. Public Network Access tends to be overly permissive and introduces unintended vectors for threat activity.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

1. Go to `SQL servers`.
2. For each SQL server, under `Security`, click `Networking`.
3. Set `Public network access` to `Disable`.
4. Click `Save`.

### Default Value

By default, Azure SQL Server's Public network access is set to `Disable`.
